The man who has attained this height and honour, has equivalent responsibilities at the same time.\n",

Evils like cruelty, immorality and ignorance which spoil and blacken the souls of humanbeings, thus pull them to a stage lower than animals, were done away with. From his mother and father, the prophet comes from a very highly distinguished family of the society he was brought up in. His father is Abdullah and his mother is Amina. He lost his father two months before his birth and also his mother at the age of six. Up to the age of eight, he remained with his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. At the death of his grandfather, his uncle Ebu-talib adopted him.\n",

    "1 - He should be wise.\n",

    "c) It is the obligation of the parents to teach their children the teachings of Islam before they attain this age. \n",
    "\n",
    "The affairs and mode of life of every wise and matured Muslim from religion's point of view can be divided into three categories :\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Those affairs which our religion orders us to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 — Those which are not allowed in our religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 — Those affairs whose performance or non-perfomance depends upon the will and choice of the devotee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of the ordered obligations :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These are the things which are to be done positively by every believer, for example things like performance of ablution, praying five times daily, fasting in the lunar month of Ramadan and paying the legal alms (Zakat) are called in Islamic terminology Fards. This type of orders must be excuted absolutely, Those who do not fulfill these obligations, will get their due punishment in the next world and those who do not believe in these Divine orders, go out of the Islamic religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Devotions like having ablution, praying, fasting in the lunar month of Ramadan, giving the legal alms (Zakat) by rich people and praying at funerals\n",
    "for the dead, are from these kinds of obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Every Muslim is personally responsible for the performance of some of these obligations (Fards). No body else can perform these Fards in his place. This type of devotions are named.as Fard-ul-Ayin (e.g. ablution, praying... etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Some other devotions are such that their performance by some sections of Muslims will absolve the rest. This kind of devotions are called Fard-ul-kifaya (e.g. prayers at funerals for the dead).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some other obligations which are not based on decisive evidences like Fards, are also to be performed and those people who de not follow them will meet their due punishments. This type of orders are called **Wadjibs** (necessary) (e.g. to pray on the morning of the first day of Eids (a) Eid-ul-Fitr (b) Eid-ul-Adha, to sacrifice a victim (animal) on the Eid-ul-Adha according to one’s means.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Those devotions which are neither Fard nor Wadjib but practised frequently and left off and on by our holy Prophet, are called **Sunna**.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Those who practise Sunna get God’s reward and those who leave them without any apparent excuse will be deprived of the intercession of the holy Prophet.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) All the things which our beloved Prophet has himself continuously done or has advised us to do them, are named «Muekked Sunna» (confirmed Sunna) e.g. two raka’at before two Fards in the morning prayer, four raka’at before and two raka’at after the four Fards in the noon prayer, two raka’at after — four Fards in the night prayer (For details, please refer to the prayer’s section.).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The Sunna which were sometimes prayed and sometimes not prayed by our holy Prophet are termed as Ghayr-Muekked Sunna (unconfirmed Sunna).\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of this type of Sunna brings God’s reward and those who do ‘not perform them are not supposed to commit any sin. Four raka’at\n",
    "Sunna before four Fards both in the after-noon and night prayers belong to this type. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Forbidden deeds :**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the deeds decisively forbidden by the Islamic religion like, murdering adultery, theft, lying disobeying the parents and conspiring. It is absolutely necessary not to commit these forbidden deeds. Those who commit them will be punished in the next world. The non-believers will go out of the Islamic religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prohibited deeds with undecisive arguments and proofs are called **Makruh** (disagreeable acts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The disagreeable deeds’ ( Makruh) are of two kinds :\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Inviolable (Tahrimen)\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Absolute (Tenzthen)\n",
    "\n",
    "Those in the first category are near to the forbidden deeds. For example, like leaving the Wadjib part of the devotion. One should abstain from them.\n",
    "Those things which disturb the devotions, are termed Disturbers (Mufsid) like speaking in prayers; eating and drinking while fasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those things which can be done or left freely are named permissible (Mubah) like eating, drinking and walking ... etc"
